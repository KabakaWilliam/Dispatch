      "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to implement a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3. First, I need to encrypt 'HELLO WORLD' and then decrypt it to verify. After that, create a brute-force decryptor that tries all 26 possible shifts on 'KHOOR ZRUOG'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also mentioned there's an external command to research a topic. But the main task is the Caesar cipher. Maybe the research command is unrelated. Let me focus on the main problem first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the Caesar cipher. The encryption part: shifting each letter by 3 positions forward. For example, H becomes K, E becomes H, etc. But I need to handle wrapping around the alphabet. So after Z, it goes back to A. Similarly, decryption would shift backward by 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about how to implement this. For encryption, take each character, check if it's a letter. If it is, convert to lowercase, shift, then back to uppercase. Non-letters remain the same. Same for decryption but shifting the other way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Testing with 'HELLO WORLD'. Encrypting H becomes K, E becomes H, L becomes O, another L becomes O, O becomes R, space remains, W becomes Z, O becomes R, R becomes U, L becomes O, D becomes G. So encrypted text should be 'KHOOR ZRUOG'. Then decrypting that by shifting back 3 should give back 'HELLO WORLD'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the brute-force decryptor. For the encrypted text 'KHOOR ZRUOG', try all shifts from 0 to 25. Each shift would decrypt the message. The correct shift is 23 (since shifting 'K' back by 23 gives H, which is the original). But since the user wants to try all 26, the decryptor should loop through each possible shift and display the result. The correct one would be when shift is 23, but since the user wants to verify, maybe the decryptor will show all possibilities, and the user can check which one makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the user said to decrypt 'KHOOR ZRUOG' using brute-force. So the brute-force part is to try all shifts and see which one gives a meaningful message. Since the original shift was 3, the brute-force would find that shifting by 23 (which is equivalent to shifting backward by 3) decrypts it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how to implement this in code. Let me outline the steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, write a function to encrypt. Then another to decrypt. Then apply encryption to 'HELLO WORLD' and check decryption. Then for the brute-force, take 'KHOOR ZRUOG' and loop through shifts 0-25, decrypt each, and display the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the user wants the answer, maybe I should write the code using Python, as the execute_code tool can run it. Let me structure the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Caesar cipher functions. Let's handle uppercase letters only, as the example uses uppercase. So for each character in the input string:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If it's a space, leave it.\n",
      "- Else, convert to uppercase, find its position (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25), shift by 3, mod 26, then convert back to a character.\n",
      "\n",
      "For encryption: shift forward. For decryption, shift backward (which is equivalent to shifting forward by 23).\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I need to get the latest GDP figures. From the search results, Nigeria's GDP for 2023 is mentioned as $363.85 billion according to Macrotrends, but there's a conflicting figure from the World Bank showing $3,012.90 billion. Wait, that seems way too high. Maybe that's a typo? The World Bank entry might be in a different currency or there's a mistake. Let me check the units. The World Bank entry says \"GDP (current US$) - Nigeria\" with 3,012.90 for 2023. That's over 3 trillion, which doesn't align with other sources. Maybe the number is in billions? Or perhaps the data is incorrect. I should cross-verify.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Africa's GDP is listed as $380.70 billion in 2023 by Macrotrends, and another source mentions USD 863 billion, which is conflicting. Wait, that might be a mistake. The Macrotrends figure is 380.70 billion, but the Embassy Paris link says 863 billion. That's a big difference. I need to check which is correct. Maybe the 863 billion is for a different year or a different measure. Let me check the sources again. The Macrotrends data for South Africa in 2023 is 380.70 billion, and the Embassy Paris mentions USD 863 billion for 2023. That's conflicting. Maybe the Embassy's figure is in another currency or there's a mistake. I should note the discrepancy but proceed with the most reliable source. \n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming Macrotrends is more accurate for both, Nigeria's GDP is $363.85 billion and South Africa's is $380.70 billion. So South Africa's GDP is larger. The percentage difference would be (380.70 - 363.85)/363.85 * 100 ≈ 4.63%. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, population. For Nigeria, the World Bank might have data. Let me search for Nigeria's population. If not, use the World Bank or other sources. Similarly for South Africa. Once I have populations, GDP per capita is GDP divided by population. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user also wants to calculate GDP per capita. Let me find the population figures. For Nigeria, the World Bank might have data. Let's say Nigeria's population is around 220 million (as of 2023 estimates). South Africa's population is about 60 million. Then GDP per capita for Nigeria would be 363.85 billion / 220 million ≈ $1,653.86. For South Africa, 380.70 billion / 60 million ≈ $6,345. So South Africa's GDP per capita would be higher. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to confirm the exact population numbers. Let me check. If Nigeria's population is 220 million and South Africa's is 60 million, then the calculations hold. However, if the populations are different, the result might change. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's initial search results for Nigeria's GDP had conflicting data. The World Bank entry for Nigeria's GDP in 2023 is listed as 3,012.90, but that seems too high. Maybe the number is in a different unit? Like, perhaps it's 301.29 billion? Or maybe the data is incorrect. I need to resolve this discrepancy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the World Bank entry is for a different year. Let me check the World Bank's data again. The entry for Nigeria's GDP (current US$) in 2023 is 3,012.90. That's over 3 trillion, which doesn't match other sources. This inconsistency is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in the search query? Or perhaps the data is in a different currency? For example, if the figure is in Nigerian Naira, converting to USD would be different. But the user's query specifies \"current US$\" so it should be in USD. \n",
      "\n",
      "This inconsistency makes it hard to proceed accurately. To resolve, perhaps I should use the Macrotrends data since it's more recent and specific to 2023. So Nigeria's GDP is $363.85 billion, South Africa's is $380.70 billion. \n",
      "\n",
      "For populations, using the World Bank's data: Nigeria's population is around 220 million, South Africa's is about 60 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, GDP per capita for Nigeria: 363.85 / 220 ≈ 1,653.86. South Africa: 380.70 / 60 ≈ 6,345. So South Africa has a higher GDP per capita. \n",

Let me start by gathering the data from the search results provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, for Nigeria's GDP. Looking at the search results, there are a few sources. The World Bank data mentions Nigeria's GDP in 2023 as $3,012.90 billion? Wait, that seems really high. Wait, no, looking again, the second result for Nigeria GDP 2023 says \"GDP (current US$) - Nigeria. Country official statistics, National ... 2023. 3,012.90. Bolivia. 2024. 54,881.33. Bosnia and Herzegovina. 2024. 29,613.57.\" Hmm, that might be a formatting error. Maybe the 3,012.90 is in billions? Or maybe it's a typo. Another source says Nigeria's GDP for 2023 was 363.85 billion US dollars, a 23.79% decline from 2022. Another one mentions 52.1 trillion naira, which is about 66.84 billion USD. Wait, there's inconsistency here. Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the third result for Nigeria says GDP for 2023 was 363.85 billion USD, down from 477.40 billion in 2022. The fifth result mentions 52.1 trillion naira, which is around 66.84 billion USD. That's conflicting. Maybe the 363.85 billion is in USD, and the 52.1 trillion naira is another figure. But which one is correct? The World Bank data might have a different figure. Alternatively, the Macrotrends.net source says 363.85 billion USD for 2023. Let me take that as the current GDP for Nigeria.\n",
      "\n",
      "For South Africa, the first search result says GDP for 2023 was 380.70 billion USD, a 6.44% decline from 2022. Another source mentions GDP in 2023 as USD 863 billion, but that seems way higher. Wait, that might be a mistake. The Macrotrends.net link for South Africa says 380.70 billion USD. The World Bank data for South Africa's GDP in 2023 is listed as 380.70 billion USD? Wait, the third result for South Africa says \"GDP (current US$) - South Africa. Country official statistics, National ... 2023, 2022, 2021...\" but the exact number isn't clear. However, the first result for South Africa's GDP 2023 says 380.70 billion USD. Let me go with that. Also, the fourth result mentions GDP in South Africa is expected to reach 405.86 billion by 2026, but that's a projection. So for 2023, 380.70 billion USD seems accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Nigeria's GDP is 363.85 billion USD, South Africa's is 380.70 billion USD. Then, South Africa's economy is larger. To find the percentage difference, subtract Nigeria's GDP from South Africa's, divide by Nigeria's GDP, then multiply by 100. So (380.70 - 363.85)/363.85 * 100 = (16.85/363.85)*100 ≈ 4.63%. So South Africa's economy is about 4.63% larger than Nigeria's.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, population. For Nigeria, the search results say 227,882,945 in 2023. South Africa's population is 63,212,384 in 2023. So Nigeria has a much larger population.\n",
      "\n",
      "GDP per capita is GDP divided by population. For Nigeria: 363.85 billion USD / 227,882,945 ≈ 1,597 USD. For South Africa: 380.70 billion USD / 63,212,384 ≈ 5,999 USD. So South Africa has a higher GDP per capita.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but let me check the numbers again. Nigeria's GDP is 363.85 billion USD. Divided by 227.88 million people: 363.85 / 227.88 ≈ 1.597 thousand USD, so ~1,597 USD. South Africa's GDP is 380.70 billion USD divided by 63.21 million: 380.70 / 63.21 ≈ 6.025 thousand USD, so ~6,025 USD. So South Africa's GDP per capita is higher.\n",

      "Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants to compare the GDP of Nigeria and South Africa, determine which is larger and by what percentage, then find their populations to calculate GDP per capita. Let me start by gathering the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, from the search results, Nigeria's GDP in 2023 was reported as $363.85 billion, while South Africa's was $380.70 billion. Wait, but there's a discrepancy here. Another source mentioned Nigeria's GDP as 3,012.90 (maybe in different units?) and South Africa's as 863 billion. Hmm, need to check which figures are correct. The Macrotrends link for Nigeria shows a 23.79% decline from 2022, so 2023 GDP is 363.85 billion USD. For South Africa, the same source says 380.70 billion USD. The World Bank data for Nigeria is 3,012.90, but that might be in another currency or a different metric. Let me confirm. The World Bank's NY.GDP.MKTP.CD for Nigeria in 2023 is 3,012.90, which is in current USD. Wait, that's about 3 trillion USD, which seems high compared to the Macrotrends figure. Maybe the units are different? Or perhaps the Macrotrends data is in billions? Let me check the units again. The Macrotrends Nigeria GDP for 2023 is 363.85 billion USD, which is about $363.85 billion. The World Bank's figure is 3,012.90, which would be $3.0129 trillion. That's a big difference. Which one is accurate? Let me cross-reference. The Wikipedia entry for Nigeria's economy mentions GDP of $5.2 billion in 2014, but that's much lower. The Statista link for Nigeria's GDP in 2023 is 66.84 billion USD for Q2. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the data is in different currencies or adjusted for inflation? This is confusing. Let me check the South Africa data. The Macrotrends data says South Africa's GDP in 2023 is $380.70 billion, and the World Bank's figure is 863 billion. That's a huge difference. The Embassy of South Africa's site mentions GDP as USD 863 billion in 2023. But the Macrotrends data is 380.70 billion. Which is correct? This inconsistency is a problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking back, the user's initial search results for Nigeria's GDP had conflicting numbers. The first result says GDP grew by 3.46% in Q4 2023, but the second result from World Bank shows 3,012.90 for 2023. The third result from Macrotrends says 363.85 billion USD for 2023. The fourth result mentions $5.2 billion, which seems too low. The fifth result from Statista says Q2 GDP was 66.84 billion USD. This inconsistency makes it hard to determine the correct figure. Similarly for South Africa, the Macrotrends data is 380.70 billion, but the Embassy's data is 863 billion. \n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests that the data might be in different units or currencies. For example, the World Bank's figure might be in local currency (Naira or Rand) converted to USD, while the Macrotrends data is in USD. Alternatively, there could be a mistake in the data entry. Given that the user's question is about comparing the two economies, I need to find a reliable source. Let's check the World Bank's data again. The World Bank's indicator NY.GDP.MKTP.CD for Nigeria in 2023 is 3,012.90, which is in current USD. That would make Nigeria's GDP around $3.01 trillion, which is much higher than the Macrotrends figure. But that seems extremely high. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are in different units, like billions vs. trillions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, looking at the World Bank's data for South Africa, the 2023 figure is 554.44 billion USD. That's different from the Macrotrends 380.70 billion. The Embassy of South Africa's site says GDP is 863 billion USD. This is conflicting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to use the most recent and reliable sources. The Macrotrends data for Nigeria is 363.85 billion USD for 2023, and South Africa's is 380.70 billion USD. These figures are from the same source, so maybe they are more consistent. Alternatively, the World Bank's data might be in a different format. \n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming that the Macrotrends data is correct, Nigeria's GDP is $363.85 billion and South Africa's is $380.70 billion. Therefore, South Africa's GDP is larger. The difference is 380.70 - 363.85 = 16.85 billion USD. To find the percentage, (16.85 / 363.85) * 100 ≈ 4.63%. So South Africa's GDP is larger by about 4.63%. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the population. Nigeria's population in 2023 is 227,882,945. South Africa's is 63,212,384. Calculating GDP per capita: Nigeria's is 363.85 billion / 227.88 million ≈ 1,596.65 USD. South Africa's is 380.70 billion / 63.21 million ≈ 60225.54 USD. Therefore, South Africa has a higher GDP per capita. \n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the earlier tool calls had some errors. For example, the user tried to calculate 3638500000000 (which is 3.6385 trillion) divided by 227882945, resulting in 15966.53. That's about $15,966.53, which is higher than the previous calculation. But that might be due to using different GDP figures. If the GDP is 3.6385 trillion, then dividing by 227.88 million gives around 15,966 USD. However, if the GDP is 363.85 billion, then it's 363,850 million, leading to 363,850 / 227.88 ≈ 1,596.65 USD. This discrepancy shows the confusion in the GDP figures. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the conflicting data, the correct approach is to use the most reliable sources. The World Bank's data for Nigeria in 2023 is 3,012.90 (which might be in USD, so $3.0129 trillion), and South Africa's is 554.44 billion USD. If that's the case, Nigeria's GDP is larger. But this contradicts the Macrotrends data. \n",
      "\n",
      "This highlights the need for accurate data. Since the user's search results have conflicting numbers, perhaps the best way is to use the figures from the World Bank, which are more official. For Nigeria, 3,012.90 (assuming USD) would be $3.0129 trillion. South Africa's is 554.44 billion USD. Then Nigeria's GDP is larger. The difference is 3,012.90 - 554.44 = 2,458.46 billion. Percentage: (2,458.46 / 554.44) * 100 ≈ 443.7%, so Nigeria's GDP is 443.7% larger than South Africa's. \n",
      "\n",
      "Population data: Nigeria's is 227.88 million, South Africa's 63.21 million. GDP per capita: Nigeria's 3,012.90 / 227.88 ≈ 13,200 USD. South Africa's 554.44 / 63.21 ≈ 8,777 USD. So Nigeria has higher GDP per capita. \n",
      "\n",
      "But this is all based on conflicting data. The user's initial search results had varying figures, making it hard to determine the exact numbers. The key is to use the most reliable sources, which might be the World Bank. However, without clear data, the answer is uncertain. \n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the Macrotrends data, South Africa's GDP is larger by about 4.63%, and South Africa has higher GDP per capita. But with the World Bank data, Nigeria's GDP is larger, and Nigeria has higher GDP per capita. The inconsistency in the data sources is the main issue here.\n",
